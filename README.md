This AI-focused RPG side project. Similar to Pokemon Quest game mechanics, the game consists of a party of heroes (a mage, healer, and tank) who journey on a mission to rescue civilians from monsters. The heroes AI will react to enemy movements and will chase after them, attack, or flee. Players will be able to strategically activate job-specific skills to support their party and defeat the monsters.
